# ReserveFlow

## Project Overview

**ReserveFlow** is a comprehensive Python-based simulation framework that models the complex dynamics between international currency reserves, precious metal holdings, and exchange rate volatilities in the global financial system. This simulation incorporates real-world policy decisions, geopolitical tensions, and market mechanisms that drive central bank reserve management strategies during periods of economic uncertainty.

## Project Context and Motivation

The global financial landscape has undergone dramatic shifts since 2022, with central banks worldwide reassessing their reserve composition strategies. China maintains the world's largest foreign exchange reserves at $3.59 trillion, followed by Japan with $1.3 trillion, while central banks purchased a record 1,045 tonnes of gold in 2024, marking the third consecutive year above 1,000 tonnes. The simulation captures these unprecedented dynamics, including the strategic shift toward non-traditional reserve currencies that now account for increasing shares of global reserves, with the US dollar's dominance eroding from over 70% in 2000 to 59% in Q1 2024.

## Simulation Architecture

### Core Components

**Reserve Management Engine**: Models central bank decision-making processes for optimal portfolio allocation across foreign currencies, gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and government securities. The engine incorporates behavioral factors such as risk tolerance, political considerations, and economic objectives that influence reserve composition decisions.

**Multi-Currency Exchange Rate System**: Implements stochastic volatility models for major reserve currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, CNY) with correlation structures that reflect real-world dependencies. The system includes regime-switching models to capture periods of calm versus crisis-driven volatility.

**Precious Metal Market Dynamics**: Simulates gold and silver price movements with supply-demand fundamentals, incorporating central bank buying patterns, mining production constraints, and investor demand cycles. The model includes realistic price discovery mechanisms and storage cost considerations.

**Geopolitical Risk Framework**: Integrates geopolitical tension indicators that affect reserve reallocation decisions, particularly modeling how events like sanctions, trade wars, and regional conflicts drive "flight to safety" behaviors and de-dollarization trends.

**Special Drawing Rights (SDR) Module**: Models the IMF's SDR system as an international reserve asset based on a basket of five currencies (USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, GBP), including allocation mechanisms and the role of SDRs in crisis response.

### Advanced Features

**Liquidity Stress Testing**: Simulates various crisis scenarios where central banks must rapidly liquidate portions of their reserves, modeling the market impact and optimal liquidation strategies across different asset classes.

**Cross-Border Capital Flow Modeling**: Tracks how reserve movements affect global capital flows, exchange rates, and monetary policy transmission mechanisms across interconnected economies.

**Policy Transmission Mechanisms**: Models how changes in major central bank policies (Federal Reserve, ECB, People's Bank of China) propagate through the global reserve system and affect smaller economies' reserve management decisions.

**Sanctions and Financial Weapon Dynamics**: Incorporates the impact of financial sanctions, such as the freezing of $300 billion in Russian central bank assets, and how such events drive fundamental changes in reserve management strategies.

## Synthetic Data Generation Framework

### Central Bank Reserve Profiles

**Major Economy Central Banks**: Generate detailed portfolios for the top 20 reserve holders, including realistic asset allocations, intervention histories, and policy mandates. Each central bank has unique characteristics reflecting their economic structure, trade relationships, and political constraints.

**Emerging Market Central Banks**: Model smaller central banks with different risk profiles, limited market access, and vulnerability to external shocks. These banks often face trade-offs between maintaining adequate reserves and domestic development financing needs.

**Regional Development Banks and Sovereign Wealth Funds**: Include non-traditional reserve managers who operate with different objectives and constraints compared to central banks.

### Market Data Simulation

**High-Frequency Exchange Rate Data**: Generate minute-by-minute exchange rate movements for all major currency pairs, incorporating realistic microstructure effects, bid-ask spreads, and trading volume patterns that vary by market session and economic announcements.

**Precious Metal Market Data**: Simulate gold and silver prices with realistic volatility clustering, seasonal patterns (particularly for silver's industrial demand), and correlation with currency movements and inflation expectations.

**Government Bond Yield Curves**: Model yield curves for major economies with realistic term structure dynamics, credit risk premiums, and flight-to-quality effects during stress periods.

**Commodity and Energy Prices**: Include oil, natural gas, and agricultural commodity prices that affect inflation expectations and currency values, particularly for commodity-exporting nations.

### Economic Indicator Time Series

**Macroeconomic Fundamentals**: Generate GDP growth rates, inflation data, trade balances, and current account positions for major economies, ensuring realistic cross-country correlations and temporal dependencies.

**Financial Stability Indicators**: Create banking sector health metrics, credit growth rates, and financial stress indices that influence central bank reserve management decisions.

**Geopolitical Risk Indices**: Develop quantitative measures of political stability, trade tension levels, and military conflict probabilities that drive risk-off sentiment and precious metal demand.

## Realistic Economic Scenarios

### Baseline Scenario: Gradual Reserve Diversification

Models the current trend of gradual diversification away from USD holdings, with central banks slowly increasing gold allocations while maintaining dollar dominance. This scenario includes:

- Steady central bank gold purchases of 800-1,200 tonnes annually
- USD share of global reserves declining by 0.5-1.0% per year
- Gradual increase in yuan and euro allocations by advanced economies
- Moderate volatility in major currency pairs with periodic intervention

### Crisis Scenario: Major Currency Disruption

Simulates a severe crisis affecting a major reserve currency, potentially triggered by:

- Sovereign debt crisis in a major economy
- Unexpected central bank policy reversals
- Large-scale geopolitical conflict affecting global trade
- Cyber attacks on critical financial infrastructure

The simulation models how central banks would respond to such shocks, including emergency asset liquidations, coordinated interventions, and rapid portfolio rebalancing.

### De-dollarization Acceleration Scenario

Models an accelerated shift away from dollar reserves driven by trade policy changes and financial weaponization concerns, including:

- Formation of alternative payment systems bypassing SWIFT
- Increased bilateral trade agreements settling in local currencies
- Rapid expansion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
- Coordinated reserve diversification by major emerging economies

### Inflation Surge and Precious Metal Rally

Incorporates projections of gold prices potentially reaching $3,000-4,000 per ounce, driven by persistent inflation and continued central bank buying. This scenario includes:

- Supply chain disruptions affecting precious metal mining
- Retail investor demand surge for inflation hedging
- Central bank gold purchases exceeding 1,500 tonnes annually
- Currency devaluation pressures affecting emerging market reserves
